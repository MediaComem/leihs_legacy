  Scenario: Computing availability of a heavily booked model should remain acceptable
    Given I am Mike
    Given the model "Kamera Nikon X12" exists
    And it has at least 500 items in the current inventory pool
    And it has at least 3 group partitions in the current inventory pool
    And it has at least 100 unsubmitted reservations in the current inventory pool
    And it has at least 100 submitted reservations in the current inventory pool
    And it has at least 100 approved reservations in the current inventory pool
    And it has at least 100 signed reservations in the current inventory pool
    When its availability is recalculate
    Then it should take maximum 0.5 seconds
