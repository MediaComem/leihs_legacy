Feature: Email templates

  As an admin or inventory manager
  I want to customize the text of the emails that leihs sends
  So that my users get all information they need
  and so that my leihs instance is unique and matches the rest
  of my organization.

    Given I am Gino
    When I specify an email template for the <action> action
    And the inventory pool in question does not have its own custom email template
    Then these templates are used for the <action>

    | received order         |
    | rejected order         |
    | submitted order        |
    | deadline soon reminder |
    | reminder               |
